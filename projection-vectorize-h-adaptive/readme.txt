This scripts contains h-adaptive methods for superconvergent patch recovery and projection-based method of square hole problem.

h-adaptive uses superconvergent patch recovery
Please run main_h_adaptive.m
There is no INPUT.
When the program run it will print the error estimation to the console.
After it finish or be terminated. The output result can be found in 'h_quad_lobatto.mat'.
'h_quad_lobatto.mat' contains adaptive mesh, stress, displacement of each iteration and error_estimator.

h-adaptive uses projection-based method
Please run test_h_refine_projection.m
There is no INPUT.
When the program run it will print the error estimation to the console.
After it finish or be terminated. The output result can be found in 'h_projection_test_p2.mat'.
'h_projection_test_p2.mat' contains adaptive mesh, mesh, stress, displacement of each iteration and error_estimator.
